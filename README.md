# Prodigy-ML-internship-task-3
 Implemented a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify images of cats and dogs using the Kaggle dataset.
 Human View vs AI View:
Left: Original image (a puppy )
Right: AI’s perspective using Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) features
Result: The model predicted “Cat” with 56.47% confidence — a misclassification that highlights how AI interprets features differently than humans.
What I Learned:
Preprocessing image data for training
Extracting HOG features for numerical representation
Training and evaluating SVM models
Visualizing predictions and confidence scores
Understanding the gap between human and AI perception
 This project taught me that ML is not just about accuracy, but about understanding how models “see” data and why they make mistakes.
